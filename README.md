# MMBsplines

A fast Mixed Model B-splines algorithm in mixed models is implementend. B-splines have local support 
and are computational attractive, because the corresponding matrices are sparse. 
A key element of the algorithm is that the local character of B-splines is preserved. 

The computation time for algorithm is linear in the number of B-splines.
